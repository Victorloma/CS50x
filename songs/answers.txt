If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
This individual seems to have a preference for high energy and highly danceable songs. These songs can either be cheerfull or sad.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
If the user both likes very euphoric and and very angry songs, this would be represented as a preference for neutral valence music.
Extreme values could also impact energy and danceability, maybe using a median value would be a better representation of a persons true preferences.
