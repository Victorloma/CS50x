Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

    The bigger the input, the longer it takes to complete the calculations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

    I would say from 1000 predictions and more the probability of winning per team stayed pretty constant.
